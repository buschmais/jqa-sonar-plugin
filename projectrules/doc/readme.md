Using this plugin in SONAR imports the issues from a previous executed jQAssistant run as violations into SONAR. jQAssistant will use concepts and constraint from the local environment.
Using this way is useful for seamless integration of jQAssistant violations into SonarQ via `SonarQube Scanner` (as example available as [sonar-maven-plugin](http://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SONAR/Analyzing+with+SonarQube+Scanner+for+Maven)) without managing the concepts in SonarQ and under complete control of the project team.
