Using this plugin in SONAR makes all jQAssistant builtin concepts and constraints available as rules. You can activate the rules, assigning them to projects and these rules are used by the [jqassistant-maven-plugin](http://buschmais.github.io/jqassistant/doc/1.1.0/#_sonarqube) via `rulesUrl` attribute.
Using this way is only useful for standalone execution of jQAssistant outside SonarQ, but using rules administered on SONAR.
